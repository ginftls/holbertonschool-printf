# holbertonschool-printf

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and involves creating a custom implementation of the printf function in the C programming language. The standard printf is a powerful tool used to format and display output, and through this project, we will replicate its core functionalities.

The goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of:

- String formatting: Handling and manipulating strings for output.
- Variadic functions: Functions that accept a variable number of arguments.
- Low-level programming: Writing code close to the system using standard libraries and system calls.
- Collaboration: Working in a team to develop a high-quality, functional program.
